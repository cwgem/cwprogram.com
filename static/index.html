								<p>This is the personal website of Chris White. Professionally I do systems administration and information security related work. Instead of focusing on one particular technology I'll consider a number of solutions and look to provide the best set of technologies. When not doing work related tasks I still take the time off hours to study up on both current and trending technologies. I also do some volunteer work for the Gentoo Linux Project.</p>
								
								<p>
								Personal time is very important to me, which I spend studying Japanese. In particular I utilize the immersion method meaning that I use Japanese on a daily basis. Currently I'm at the level to where I can read novels as well as utilize Japanese dictionaries. When given a chance I travel there to visit friends and catch up on culture points of interest.

								<h2 class="major">History</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The first part of my professional IT experience was working on PHP web development for marketing companies. This was a time when many of the popular web frameworks were in their early stages and AJAX was just starting to pick up popularity. While providing a number of invaluable programming fundamentals most of the projects had little variation and it became apparent that my skills weren't being tested in a manner that helped improve knowledge. To help deal with this thirst for knowledge I took part in the Gentoo Linux project.</p>
								
								<p>
								Most of the deep level debugging and linux administration skills are highly due to my involvement in the Gentoo Linux project. Instead of just being satisfied as a standard user I instead went further and joined as a core developer. Given the immense number of software packages available I was exposed to a number of build systems, programming languages, and debugging methods. While spending a few years with the project I ended up needing to take a long break to help focus on both work related projects and non-technical skills.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								My last employer, Engine Yard, was where I picked up a large number of my core systems administration and information security skills. It also become a key player in helping me understand how businesses work in general and how to compromise between IT and management needs. While there was collaboration with other teams and team members, most of the day to day work was between myself and another coworker. The particular core experiences at the company included:
								</p>
								
								<ul>
								<li>Generation of Gentoo EC2 images based on specific software requirements</li>
								<li>Automation using Chef</li>
								<li>Ruby related development as the company projects were mostly written with it</li>
								<li>Adapting to company structure changes</li>
								<li>Handling security advisories for core software (OpenSSL, nginx, ruby, etc.)</li>
								<li>Packaging of anything from standard development tools to complex projects such as Percona server</li>
								<li>Assisting the support team with debugging OS level issues</li>
								<li>Authoring the proposal of a large legacy system upgrade, as well as putting that upgrade into place</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Due to some restructuring of the company I was unfortunately laid off on October 2016 after 5 years of employment at the company. Since then I have been switching between improving my technical skills to make myself a better candidate and reaching out to potential employers. Most of the searching though has proved to be slow moving until recently due to my layoff occurring right around the holiday season. I'm now looking again at both employment opportunities as well as potential freelance work.
